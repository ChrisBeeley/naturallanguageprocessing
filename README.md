# NLP of patient experience data in the NHS

This is the project that I am completing within the data science accelerator programme, focused on NLP of staff and patients experience data.

I'll try to update this README once the project is a bit more advanced, read the ProjectPlanAndResults.Rmd or its HTML version for more details

Part of the point of doing this is trying to make tools that others can use, so I may as well develop it in the open right from the start.

PRs welcome ;-)
