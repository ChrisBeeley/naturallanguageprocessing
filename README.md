# Data mining of patient experience data in the NHS

This is the project that I am completing within the data science accelerator programme, focused on NLP of staff and patients experience data.

Read the ProjectPlanAndResults.Rmd or its HTML version for more details

It should be possible in principle to run all the code based on the data in this repository, but it isn't structured in the most logical way for others to make sense of, and there's quite a bit of work in a different repository which is hard to share here.

I hope to come back to this to make a pipeline that's easier to just run straight from the repository.
